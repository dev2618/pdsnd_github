 US Bikeshare Data - Python

This project is part of Udacity Programming for Data Science Nanodegree - Python.

Overview

Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles for short trips, typically 30 minutes or less. Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used. In this project, you will perform an exploratory analysis on data provided by Motivate, a bike-share system provider for many major cities in the United States. You will compare the system usage between three large cities: New York City, Chicago, and Washington, DC. You will also see if there are any differences within each system for those users that are registered, regular users and those users that are short-term, casual users.

Software used

• Python3, NumPy, and pandas installed using Anacoda. • Atom text editor • Git Bash.

The Datasets

The datasets provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider in the US, contains randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 for all three cities. The data files for all three cities contain the same core six columns:

• Start Time • End Time • Trip Duration • Start Station • End Station • User Type

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:

• Gender • Birth Year

Statistics Computed

1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)

Most common month most common day of week most common hour of day

2 Popular stations and trip

Most common start station most common end station most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

3 Trip duration

Total travel time average travel time

4 User info

Counts of each user type counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago) earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago
